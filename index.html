                <h3>Intermediate</h3>
                <p>Admission to this course is based on marks obtained for the SSLC (Class 10th), awarded after successful completion of five years of primary school, followed by five years of secondary school. The Indian education system follows a 10+2+3 (4 or 5) pattern, so that a bachelor's degree requires a minimum of 10 years of primary and secondary schooling, plus two years of Higher Secondary Education in Senior Secondary Schools (Almost all National and State Boards) i.e Schools which provide Higher Secondary Schooling for Class 11th & Class 12th or in Junior Colleges (Some State Boards) university.</p>

            <div class="course-col">
                <h3>Degree</h3>
                <p>A bachelor's degree or baccalaureate is an undergraduate academic degree awarded by colleges and universities upon completion of a course of study lasting three to six years (depending on institution and academic discipline). The two most common bachelor's degrees are the Bachelor of Arts (BA) and the Bachelor of Science (BS or BSc). In some institutions and educational systems, certain bachelor's degrees can only be taken as graduate or postgraduate educations after a first degree has been completed, although degree is a prerequisite for further courses such as a master's or a doctorate.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="course-col">
                <h3>Post Graduation</h3>
                <p>Postgraduate education involves learning and studying for academic or professional degrees, academic or professional certificates, academic or professional diplomas, or other qualifications for which a first or bachelor's degree generally is required, and it is normally considered to be part of higher education. In North America, this level is typically referred to as graduate school (and often colloquially as grad school).

                    The organization and structure of postgraduate education varies in different countries, as well as in different institutions.</p>

                <p>"Generally speaking, an Indian university must regard itself as one of the living organs of national reconstruction. It must discover the best means of blending together both the spiritual and the material aspects of life. It must equip its alumni irrespective of caste, creed or sex, with individual fitness, not for its own sake, not for merely adorning varied occupations and professions, but in order to teach them how to merge their individuality in the common cause of advancing the progress and prosperity of their motherland and upholding the highest traditions of human civilisation."

Concord gave me lasting friendships, and the strength and knowledge that I am able to achieve my goals no matter the obstacles faced. My experience in Concord has taught me true strength, and that it is okay to ask for help.The teachers made you feel welcome. The people you met, all from diverse backgrounds, became your companions. I believe they were a big influence in my life and helped to shape me into the person I am today.”
